# You are given two linked lists: list1 and list2 of sizes n and m respectively.

# Remove list1's nodes from the ath node to the bth node, and put list2 in their place.

# The blue edges and nodes in the following figure indicate the result:

# ï¿¼
# Build the result list and return its head.

# Example 1:

# Input: list1 = [10,1,13,6,9,5], a = 3, b = 4, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002]
# Output: [10,1,13,1000000,1000001,1000002,5]
# Explanation: We remove the nodes 3 and 4 and put the entire list2 in their place. The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.
# Example 2:

# Input: list1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6], a = 2, b = 5, list2 = [1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004]
# Output: [0,1,1000000,1000001,1000002,1000003,1000004,6]
# Explanation: The blue edges and nodes in the above figure indicate the result.

# Constraints:

# 3 <= list1.length <= 104
# 1 <= a <= b < list1.length - 1
