# connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c.

# A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group.

# You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise.

# Return the total number of provinces.


# Example 1:

# ï¿¼
# Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
# Output: 2
# Example 2:

# Input: isConnected = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
# Output: 3
