# There are n cities numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network form a tree). Last year, The ministry of transport decided to orient the roads in one direction because they are too narrow.

# Roads are represented by connections where connections[i] = [ai, bi] represents a road from city ai to city bi.

# This year, there will be a big event in the capital (city 0), and many people want to travel to this city.

# Your task consists of reorienting some roads such that each city can visit the city 0. Return the minimum number of edges changed.

# It's guaranteed that each city can reach city 0 after reorder.


# Example 1:

# ￼
# Input: n = 6, connections = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
# Output: 3
# Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
# Example 2:

# ￼
# Input: n = 5, connections = [[1,0],[1,2],[3,2],[3,4]]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: Change the direction of edges show in red such that each node can reach the node 0 (capital).
# Example 3:

# Input: n = 3, connections = [[1,0],[2,0]]
# Output: 0
