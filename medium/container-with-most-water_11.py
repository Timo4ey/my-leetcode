# You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).

# Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

# Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

# Notice that you may not slant the container.


# Example 1:

# ï¿¼
# Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
# Output: 49
# Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
# Example 2:

# Input: height = [1,1]
# Output: 1

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:
        water = start = 0
        end = len(height) - 1
        while start <= end:
            water = max(water, (end - start) * min(height[start], height[end]))
            if height[start] < height[end]:
                start += 1
            else:
                end -= 1
        return water
