# You are given the root of a full binary tree with the following properties:

# Leaf nodes have either the value 0 or 1, where 0 represents False and 1 represents True.
# Non-leaf nodes have either the value 2 or 3, where 2 represents the boolean OR and 3 represents the boolean AND.
# The evaluation of a node is as follows:

# If the node is a leaf node, the evaluation is the value of the node, i.e. True or False.
# Otherwise, evaluate the node's two children and apply the boolean operation of its value with the children's evaluations.
# Return the boolean result of evaluating the root node.

# A full binary tree is a binary tree where each node has either 0 or 2 children.

# A leaf node is a node that has zero children.


# Example 1:

# ï¿¼
# Input: root = [2,1,3,null,null,0,1]
# Output: true
# Explanation: The above diagram illustrates the evaluation process.
# The AND node evaluates to False AND True = False.
# The OR node evaluates to True OR False = True.
# The root node evaluates to True, so we return true.
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [0]
# Output: false
# Explanation: The root node is a leaf node and it evaluates to false, so we return false.


# Constraints:

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 3
# Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
# Leaf nodes have a value of 0 or 1.
# Non-leaf nodes have a value of 2 or 3.
