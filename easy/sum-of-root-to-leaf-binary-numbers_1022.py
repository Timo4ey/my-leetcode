# You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value 0 or 1. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit.

# For example, if the path is 0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1, then this could represent 01101 in binary, which is 13.
# For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.

# The test cases are generated so that the answer fits in a 32-bits integer.

# Example 1:

# ï¿¼
# Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
# Output: 22
# Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
# Example 2:

# Input: root = [0]
# Output: 0

# Constraints:s

# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
# Node.val is 0 or 1.
